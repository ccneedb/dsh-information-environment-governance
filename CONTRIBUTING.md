# Contributing to IEG

Thanks for considering a contribution. IEG (Information Environment Governance)
is an additive project-governance plugin for
[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). It is a
**verifiable prototype**, not a released product — current status and numbers are
in [`MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md`](MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md) §3–§4.

This document is the process contract. The technical contract lives in
[`ARCHITECTURE-SPEC-AGENT-REFERENCE.md`](ARCHITECTURE-SPEC-AGENT-REFERENCE.md);
the product scope and the explicit out-of-scope list live in
[`PRODUCT-SPEC.md`](PRODUCT-SPEC.md) §1.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Why | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js **>= 20** | `package.json` `engines` | `node --test` is the test runner |
| A DeepSeek Harness installation (`@deepseek-ai/dsh`) | The integration tests mount the **real** host services rather than mocks | Without it those tests **skip**; the unit and conformance suites still run. Single supported baseline `0.2.1-alpha.1` (declared peer range `>=0.2.1-alpha.1 <0.3.0`, verified release map and committed baseline re-captured in 0.8.0). The retired `0.2.0-rc.2` baseline is **SUPERSEDED** |
| `pnpm` (via `dsh plugin add`) | `scripts/verify.sh` performs a real install into a throwaway profile | Only needed for the full chain; the `dsh-ieg` lifecycle is npm-native |

If your DSH installation is not at `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh`
point the test loader at it:

```bash
export IEG_DSH_PACKAGES=/path/to/node_modules/@deepseek-ai
```

The verification chain's throwaway home can be relocated with `IEG_VERIFY_HOME`.

## Installing IEG

Order matters: **`dsh-ieg` ships with the package, so it can never be the first
step.** Install through the host, then manage with the CLI.

```bash
# 1. install (registry name, absolute path, git address, or tarball)
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add https://github.com/ccneedb/dsh-information-environment-governance
dsh --profile <profile> --dump-config | grep -A3 'id: ieg'      # the row must compose

# 2. only now does the CLI exist — inside the profile, not on PATH
"$DSH_HOME/profiles/<profile>/node_modules/.bin/dsh-ieg" status
```

- Prefer the DSH-native path. Do not add a wrapper that calls `dsh-ieg` before the
  package is installed, and do not document one as a first-install step.
- A local checkout or a release tarball uses the same command with
  `"file:<path>"`; `npm pack` builds exactly the artifact npm would publish.
- Discovery uses the ecosystem's existing mechanism — the npm keywords
  (`dsh-plugin`, `dsh`, `deepseek-harness`) and the GitHub repository topics
  (`dsh-plugin`, `dsh`, `deepseek-harness`, `information-environment`). There is no
  separate marketplace protocol to implement.
- Never claim the package is published, and never present the declared peer range
  as a tested-versions list: exactly one DSH release, `0.2.1-alpha.1`, is verified.
- `scripts/verify.sh` proves the distribution path end to end: `npm pack`, a
  DSH-native install of that tarball into a fresh profile, row composition, the
  shipped runtime, and the profile-local `dsh-ieg` command.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | entry point, install, and evidence chain |
| `PRODUCT-SPEC.md` | positioning, scope, goals, requirements, success criteria |
| `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC-AGENT-REFERENCE.md` | architecture; **Part A** verified host seams and deltas, **Part B** the target design and §32 gates |
| `MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md` | current status and numbers (**§3–§4**), blockers, backlog, process gotchas |
| `TESTING.md` | volunteer install, first trial, A/B check, and deviation reporting |
| `SECURITY.md` | boundaries, accepted limits, and vulnerability reporting |
| `IMPLEMENTATION-VALIDATION-HANDOFF.md` | retired — a pointer to the §32 gates and the build order |
| `docs/DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md` | document inventory and the single-source-of-truth map |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` | the issue forms a deviation report and a feature request use |
| `scripts/` | repository tooling: `check-install.sh`, `check-docs.sh`, `verify.sh`, `capture-baseline.mjs` |
| repository root | the installable package: `package.json` + `cordis.patch.yml` (the DSH bundle), `lib/` kernel and modules, `src/` TypeScript sources, `bin/ieg`, `test/`, and `scripts/verify.sh` |
| `eval/` | behavioural and end-to-end evaluation harness and scenarios |

## Running the checks

This is the single home for the verification commands; other documents link here
instead of restating them.

```bash
./scripts/check-docs.sh    # from the repository root: docs links, front matter, index coverage

npm run build              # compile src/**/*.ts into lib (also runs as pretest)
npm run typecheck          # tsc, strict, against the ambient seam contract
npm test                   # node --test — unit, conformance, and integration
./scripts/verify.sh        # the full evidence chain, including a real profile install
```

`scripts/verify.sh` is the **release gate**. Its chain is: build, strict
typecheck, tests, a real install into a throwaway profile, row composition
positive proof against the installed artifact, and a CLI smoke check plus a
`prompt.md` round-trip. It never touches your real profile. It creates
`.ieg-verify/` (honouring `IEG_VERIFY_HOME`) and `.pnpm-store/`; both are
gitignored.

Behavioural evaluation (`eval/`) runs **real agents** and therefore costs model
calls and needs credentials. It is deliberately not part of CI or `npm test`.
See [`eval/README.md`](eval/README.md).

## Source-language policy

**TypeScript is the only permitted hand-written runtime/application language.**
The plugin's runtime lives in `src/**/*.ts` and is compiled to the committed
`lib/**` by `tsc`. There are exactly three documented exceptions, and each is
enforced by `test/integration/packaging.test.js` rather than left to convention:

| Exception | Why it exists |
|---|---|
| `lib/**` | generated output; never edit it by hand |
| `bin/ieg` | the extensionless shim the host's `bin` mapping requires |
| `scripts/`, `eval/`, `test/` | tooling, evaluation and tests — not shipped |

Adding a hand-written `.js` runtime module is a review rejection. If a change
seems to need one, say so in the pull request instead of committing it.

## Official installation paths

There are exactly two, and no third IEG-specific mechanism:

1. **`dsh-market`** — the DSH plugin market ecosystem.
2. **DSH native plugin installation** — `dsh plugin --profile <p> add <source>`
   where `<source>` is a registry name, absolute path, git address or tarball.

Updates are "remove the old installation, install the new one"; there is no IEG
updater. `dsh-ieg` manages the prompt of an installed plugin and nothing else.

## Rules that keep this project maintainable

These are enforced by the conformance suite or by review, and they are the
reason the project is as small as it is:

1. **One additive prompt section.** Modules never register their own section;
   the compiler emits exactly one (`ieg:governance`). Never set `complete: true`
   — it replaces the host system prompt.
2. **Deterministic enforcement over prompt text.** If a rule is mechanically
   checkable, enforce it at a seam (`tools/pre-execute`, `ctx.tools.guard`
   `agent/pre-step`) and **do not restate it in the prompt**; the conformance
   suite fails if you do.
3. **Host semantics stay authoritative.** IEG supplements; it never overrides
   plan mode, the permission/approval model, the sandbox, or
   `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`.
4. **Zero runtime dependencies, zero first-party imports.**
   [`lib/contract.d.ts`](lib/contract.d.ts) is the single auditable
   record of the host seams; every import in the package is relative.
5. **`apply()` never throws.** Register each capability in its own guarded step;
   a fault must degrade into something observable.
6. **No document that duplicates another.** If a change's content substantially
   overlaps an existing document, amend that document instead of adding a file.
7. **Attribute every prompt change.** A change to the compiled prompt text
   requires `PROMPT_VERSION` to change and a [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)
   entry naming the problem or evaluation result that motivated it.
8. **Do not commit regenerable artifacts or credentials — with one deliberate
   exception.** `.gitignore` covers the known regenerable trees (`.ieg-verify/`
   `.pnpm-store/`, `eval/runs/`, result JSON); if you find a new one, add it there
   rather than committing it. The **compiled runtime `lib/**` is the exception**:
   it is committed so a Git install is self-contained, because pnpm does not run a
   build for a git dependency. Never edit it by hand — build it from `src/**`
   ([`TYPESCRIPT-MIGRATION.md`](TYPESCRIPT-MIGRATION.md) §2.2).
9. **Stay inside the declared scope.** General safety/security, sandboxing
   authorization, user-attention optimization, and unrelated agent behavior
   management are out of scope; a new feature must show a direct connection to
   Information Environment Governance ([`PRODUCT-SPEC.md`](PRODUCT-SPEC.md) §1.4).
   Do not reintroduce the withdrawn `user-attention` seam implicitly.

## Adding a module

Follow the dependency order: identify the problem (a failure class, not a
symptom); confirm the host seam that can enforce it; define the smallest
enforcement mechanism; define the state; define the prompt contribution; define
the tests; then implement. Failure classes `FC-2.1`, `FC-2.2`, and `FC-2.3` are
each claimed by exactly one enabled module; `FC-2.4` was withdrawn.

Before changing existing policy text: name the failure or rationale, re-check host
compatibility, bump the module version if the semantics changed, add or update a
regression test, and preserve baseline behaviour unless evidence supports the
change.

## Submitting a change

- Keep a change set focused: one problem, one set of tests, one verification run.
- Add or update tests for any behavioural change. A prompt change without a
  conformance test is incomplete.
- Run `npm run typecheck && npm test` before opening a pull request, and say in
  the description whether you also ran `./scripts/verify.sh`.
- Do not weaken a test to make it pass. A `todo` test that executes and fails is
  worse than no test: it makes a green run mean less. Prefer deleting an
  assertion that belongs to another composition.
- Never include credentials, session logs, or private file contents in a commit
  an issue, or a pull request. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Release policy

IEG is **not production-ready**: the model-backed behavioural gates C
(improvement) and D (information integrity) have no valid measurement for the
current prompt revision, packaging (Gate I) is partial, the package is
no `private` flag (publishable and verified), and the publish target is undecided. The rules a release must
satisfy are in
[`ARCHITECTURE-SPEC-AGENT-REFERENCE.md`](ARCHITECTURE-SPEC-AGENT-REFERENCE.md)
Part B and the acceptance matrix in its §32. In short:

- semver; a change to compiled prompt text or to the durable record shape forces
  at least a minor bump and a changelog entry;
- a new host release is added to `dsh.compatibility.dshReleases` only after the
  compatibility baseline test passes and the baseline file is reviewed. The
  current single baseline is `0.2.1-alpha.1`, re-captured and reviewed in 0.8.0;
- `scripts/verify.sh` must pass against the pinned host version;
- `npm pack` must contain exactly the `files` allowlist, with no consumer-side
  build step: the package ships the compiled `lib/`, and the only build is the
  `src/**/*.ts` → `lib/` compile wired through `npm run build`/`pretest`.
