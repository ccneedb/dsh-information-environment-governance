/**
 * Module: `workspace-governance` (M4).
 *
 * **Problem:** unauthorized persistent workspace mutation.
 * **Objective:** make workspace structure an explicitly governed part of project state.
 *
 * Verified host facts that shape this module (`ARCHITECTURE-SPEC` §17.3, §17.4):
 *
 * - `tools/pre-execute` is the only pre-execution, scope-isolated view of a call,
 *   and it exposes `(name, arguments)` but **cannot rewrite** arguments.
 * - Returning `{ kind: 'ask' }` makes the tool registry resolve the human prompt
 *   through `ctx.approval`, inheriting its fail-closed path. IEG must not
 *   reimplement approval.
 * - `ctx.tools.guard()` is monotonic and deny-only, so it is the correct
 *   backstop for a rule that listener ordering must not be able to defeat.
 * - IEG must never compute filesystem containment; `ctx.sandboxPolicy` owns it.
 *
 * Boundary: this is **tool-mediated** mutation governance. A plugin calling
 * `ctx.fs.writeText()` directly dispatches no `fs/*` events and bypasses
 * `tools/*`; IEG does not claim process-wide write coverage.

 * (R8-04). PowerShell entries were removed rather than kept as unreachable
 * platform-specific branches.

 * Whether a shell command can create, overwrite, or remove a file.
 *
 * IEG excludes shell tools from `mutatingTools` and inspects the command text
 * instead, because gating every shell call would block `ls`, `grep`, and
 * `node --test`. The cost of that exclusion was a coverage hole: a document can
 * be created with a shell redirection rather than the `write` tool, bypassing
 * the overlap gate entirely. This closes that hole without opening one in the
 * other direction: quoted text is data unless the command wraps another command,
 * so `rg '=>' src` is not mistaken for a write.
 *
 * Two residual limits are measured by `test/unit/shell-classification.test.js`
 * rather than hidden: a wrapper invoked indirectly (`env bash -c '…'`) is
 * treated as data. Shell support is scoped to the supported environment (Debian/Linux +
 * DSH); see `SECURITY.md` for the boundary this inspection does and does not cover.
