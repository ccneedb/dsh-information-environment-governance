/**
 * Module: `project-governance` (M1, delivered first because it establishes the
 * common project-state vocabulary).
 *
 * **Problem:** the agent advances without a sufficiently stable project model.
 * **Objective:** maintain semantic alignment across the task lifetime.
 *
 * State is a compact, structured record — never a transcript copy. The whole
 * value is replaced on every transition, matching the host rule that a
 * state-carrying log event carries the complete post-change state.
 *
 * Boundary: DSH plan mode remains the host's planning mechanism. This module
 * governs project orientation and continuity, not a replacement plan workflow.
 *
 * Orientation semantics (Batch 1, 0.7.0). The recorded orientation is what the
 * agent has **declared**: intent, objective, scope, terminology, constraints,
 * assumptions, unknowns and phase. A declaration is not evidence of behavioural
 * consistency, and the two are deliberately separate concepts. A future
 * "Orientation Consistency" direction is therefore named but NOT implemented:
 *
 *   declared constraints -> observed actions -> consistency / drift evaluation
 *
 * Nothing here evaluates observed actions, and the gate must never be described
 * as if it did.
