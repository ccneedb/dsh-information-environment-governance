/**
 * Information Environment Governance (IEG) — Cordis plugin entry.
 *
 * Contributes exactly **one** additive system-prompt section and binds
 * deterministic enforcement to verified host seams (`ARCHITECTURE-SPEC` §17):
 *
 * ```text
 * system prompt     -> ctx.systemPrompt.section()      (advisory)
 * step admission    -> agent/pre-step                  (veto: reject)
 * mutation gate     -> tools/pre-execute               (gate: ask / deny)
 * mutation backstop -> ctx.tools.guard()               (monotonic deny)
 * ```
 *
 * The plugin has **zero runtime imports** from first-party packages: everything
 * it needs arrives through the injected Cordis context. That keeps it mountable
 * in any composition and immune to the profile's module-resolution layout.
