/**
 * IEG kernel — per-agent governance state.
 *
 * The `0.1.0` prototype held every ledger once per composition, so two
 * concurrent agents shared one orientation, and a second session could satisfy
 * the first session's gate. That is a correctness
 * defect, not a cosmetic one (ARCHITECTURE-SPEC Part B §25, delta D15).
 *
 * The verified host fact behind the fix is §17.7: the per-agent scope key **is
 * the agent object itself**, and every seam IEG binds already carries that
 * object — `AssembleContext.agent` (merge-extended by `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent`),
 * the `agent/pre-step` payload, `tools/pre-execute`'s `exec.agent`, and the
 * `tools/result` and `fs/*` actor.
 *
 * IEG therefore keys its live state by that object identity. Identity keying
 * gives the same isolation as a scope-keyed store, releases state with the agent
 * instead of leaking it, and preserves the package's zero-first-party-import
 * property: `ScopedLayers` would require importing `@deepseek-ai/dsh-scope`
 * (§25.3, assumption B3).
