/**
 * IEG kernel — prompt compiler (`ARCHITECTURE-SPEC-AGENT-REFERENCE.md` §5.2).
 *
 * Aggregates the kernel's stable principles with the enabled modules' principles
 * and prompt fragments into **one** additive section, removing duplicated
 * statements and enforcing the §11 prompt budget.
 *
 * Two host facts shape this module:
 *
 * 1. `renderPrompt` interpolates strict `{{variable}}` syntax and **throws** on
 *    an unknown or undefined reference. IEG therefore registers its section with
 *    `interpolate: false`, and the compiler additionally refuses to emit text
 *    containing interpolation syntax so the two defences agree.
 * 2. IEG must never set `complete: true`: one effective complete section
 *    replaces the entire assembled prompt, and two make assembly fail.
 *
 * Migrated from `prompt-compiler.js` (2026-10-02). This is the source of truth;
 * `lib/kernel/prompt-compiler.js` is the `tsc` build artifact that
 * DSH actually loads (see `TYPESCRIPT-MIGRATION.md`).

 *
 * Deliberately **not** re-recorded at `0.5.0`: the maintenance rule added in
