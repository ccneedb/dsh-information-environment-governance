/**
 * IEG kernel — host compatibility adapter (ARCHITECTURE-SPEC §29, PR-07).
 *
 * A DSH peer range is **declared** (`dsh.engines.dsh`), but it is not enforced and
 * nothing observes whether the **running** host's prompt surface still matches what
 * IEG was verified against (§29.1). Batch 10 established the first half of that
 * sentence's replacement: the installed host enforces only `peerDependencies`, which
 * IEG does not declare, so an out-of-range host is not refused on the strength of the
 * declaration (MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md §4.3). This module closes that gap without
 * depending on a version string — the installed `0.2.1-alpha.1` exposes no
 * plugin-facing version service (§29.2) — by observing the seam facts that would
 * actually change a decision:
 *
 * ```text
 * ordered section names            assembly.sections.map(s => s.name)
 * IEG section presence + position  index of 'ieg:governance'
 * host section text hash           stableHash of the non-IEG section texts
 * contexts / tools counts          assembly.contexts.length, assembly.tools.length
 * capability inventory             supplied by the composition (ctx.get)
 * ```
 *
 * **`AssembledSection` carries `name`, `text`, and `interpolate` — not `order`.**
 * The ordered name array *is* the resolved placement, which is exactly the drift
 * signal that matters (§29.3).
 *
 * **Fail-open.** A listener on the `system-prompt/assemble` expert waterfall must
 * call `next()`; the adapter observes only and never blocks or denies. Nothing
 * here ever throws into the assembly path — a compatibility probe must never be
 * able to break prompt assembly — so both `observe` and `classify` accept any
 * malformed input and degrade to `PENDING`.
 *
 * Zero runtime dependencies: only language built-ins (`Math`, `JSON`, `Set`,
 * `WeakMap`).
