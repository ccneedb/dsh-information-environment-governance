# Changelog

> **Naming history.** This project was previously `dsh-agent-behavioral-governance`
> ("ABG"); `0.7.0` renames it to `dsh-information-environment-governance` (IEG).
> Pre-0.7.0 entries below deliberately keep the historical name — a changelog is
> immutable history, so old entries are not rewritten to the new name.

All notable changes to `dsh-information-environment-governance` (IEG) are
recorded here; entries before 0.7.0 were written under the historical package
name and keep it.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Per `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC-AGENT-REFERENCE.md` §31.2, a change to the compiled
prompt text or to the durable record shape forces at least a minor bump, and
**every prompt change is attributed to the problem or evaluation result that
motivated it**. IEG records a prompt revision in four places, and an entry below
names the one it changes: the package `version`, the enforced
`dsh.engines.dsh` range, `dsh.compatibility.dshReleases`, `PROMPT_VERSION`, and
the governance state `DOMAIN_VERSION` (§22.3).

## [0.11.0] — 2026-10-04

**Prompt refinement (Batch 6 §8).** `PROMPT_VERSION` 0.4.0 -> **0.5.0**.

### Added

- One rule to the information-integrity module: *when the environment reports
  maintenance as due, run one maintenance round at the next safe boundary and report
  its proposals.* It is the model-owned half of the seven-batch trigger — the
  due-marking is deterministic, the timing and the reporting are guidance — and it
  is stated as an action rather than as a restatement of enforcement.

### Measured

- The compiled section is **2,806 bytes** (from 2,677) and still fits the
  **2,945-byte ceiling established at 0.4.0**. `RECORDED_PROMPT_BYTES` is
  deliberately **not** re-recorded: a budget recomputed at every revision would
  follow the text it exists to bound, which is the failure the constant prevents.
  The compiler comment now says so.

### Audited, and deliberately not changed

- **The two deletion rules were left verbatim.** They read as if the first
  ("delete information you have established is wrong") and the second ("delete
  outdated and superseded content as well, except in a software development
  project, where… mark it explicitly as outdated") might contradict for a software
  project. Merging them was attempted, and reverted: both are **pinned OBJ-2
  acceptance phrases**, and a minimality pass is not authority to rewrite an
  acceptance criterion. The ambiguity is recorded in the capability matrix as a
  follow-up, not silently resolved.
- No unsupported expectation was found to remove. The full rule-to-boundary mapping
  is in `MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md` -> "Prompt rule -> capability boundary": twenty
  rules, each marked deterministic, heuristic or guidance, with the guidance-only
  ones named as unverified.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-10-04

**The information environment maintenance round (Batch 6).** IEG stops only
governing actions and starts maintaining the environment as well — within a
capability boundary it states explicitly.

### Added

- **`maintain_environment`, a read-only maintenance round.** It inventories the
  workspace's persistent artifacts, classifies them (authoritative specification,
  implementation documentation, configuration, working note, generated, historical,
  temporary, unknown), diagnoses duplication, obsolescence and declared drift, and
  returns proposed actions from the fixed vocabulary `KEEP | MERGE | UPDATE |
  REPLACE | DEPRECATE | REMOVE | LEAVE_UNCHANGED | REQUIRES_REVIEW` — each with a
  reason and a confidence. It is read-only by construction: an unknown tool is
  read-only under `tools/pre-execute`, so the round cannot mutate anything even if
  asked to.
- **The seven-instruction-batch trigger.** `agent/pre-step` counts direct user
  instruction batches using the host's own turn accounting — a new `turn` carrying
  at least one user message. Internal steps, tool calls and generated context are
  excluded by construction, not by filtering. At seven, maintenance is marked due in
  the runtime context; a completed round resets the counter and records how many
  batches it was reset from.
- **Role-aware placement governance.** The duplicate check now injects the
  functional-role classifier and a material-distinctness predicate: a filename
  subject match counts as duplication only when the artifact would serve the *same
  role* and the information is not materially distinct. Lexical similarity alone no
  longer decides it (Batch 6 §4). `overlap.ts` remains import-free; the classifiers
  are passed in.

### Deliberately not implemented

- **Free-text stale-statement detection.** A version-shaped string scan was
  implemented, run against this repository, and removed: it raised ten
  `REQUIRES_REVIEW` findings on a healthy tree, because changelogs, migration
  records and batch plans legitimately quote historical versions. Declared state
  (front matter `plugin_version`) is checked precisely instead. Cross-document
  contradiction detection beyond that remains a **future** capability, not a claim.
- **Automatic application of any action.** The round proposes; destructive actions
  need an explicit human decision.

### Verification

- A real round over this repository: 24 artifacts scanned, inventory
  `authoritative-specification=2 configuration=9 implementation-documentation=9
  historical=1 unknown=3`, findings `DEPRECATE=1 LEAVE_UNCHANGED=22 KEEP=1`,
  **unresolved = 0**, no false positives.

## [0.9.3] — 2026-10-04

**Documentation convergence and automated enforcement.** No runtime behaviour
changed in this release; every change is documentation, tests or drift detection.

### Changed

- **The documentation now describes the reduced surface.** The 0.9.2 removals
  (installation lifecycle, control plane, menu, `prompt reset`) were still
  described as current in `docs/PACKAGE-REFERENCE.md`,
  `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC-AGENT-REFERENCE.md`, `MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md`, `TESTING.md`
  and `TYPESCRIPT-MIGRATION.md`. Those passages are rewritten to the two-command
  prompt CLI, and the few remaining mentions are explicitly historical — a
  changelog and a design record are history, so the record of what was removed is
  kept and marked rather than erased.

### Added

- **Source-language enforcement.** `test/integration/packaging.test.js` asserts the
  TypeScript-only rule: `src/**` holds only `.ts`, no hand-written JavaScript sits
  at the repository root, and the build output carries no hand-written tooling. The
  documented exceptions are `lib/**` (generated), `bin/ieg` (the host-mandated
  shim) and `scripts/`, `eval/`, `test/`.
- **Release-metadata drift detection.** The same suite asserts one version agrees
  across `package.json`, `PLUGIN_VERSION`, the newest changelog heading and every
  document's `plugin_version`, and that the committed baseline file names the
  declared peer baseline.

## [0.9.2] — 2026-10-04

**Architecture simplification, installation consolidation and source-language governance.**

### Removed

- **The IEG installation and lifecycle architecture.** `dsh-ieg install`, `update`
  and `uninstall` are gone — implementation, CLI commands, the profile-name
  validation, the npm wrapper scripts, and their tests. A plugin cannot install
  itself, so IEG had duplicated what the host already owns.
- **The 0.6.0 control plane.** `dsh-ieg start|pause|restart|exit|status`, the
  durable control record, its mtime cache, the generation counter, the
  `generation`-driven re-read, the interactive ANSI menu, and the five
  `ieg.control_*` diagnostics. Turning governance off for a profile is
  `enabled: false` in the row config — one mechanism, not two.
- **`dsh-ieg prompt reset`**, and with it the now-unused file-deletion path.

### Changed

- **`dsh-ieg` is a prompt CLI**: `prompt` (view the effective text, its version
  and byte count) and `prompt edit` (validate an edited copy, then store it),
  plus `--help`/`--version`. It has no installation surface.
- **Exactly two official installation paths** remain: `dsh-market` and DSH's own
  plugin installer (`dsh plugin --profile <p> add <source>`). Updates are
  deliberately "remove the old installation, install the new one".
- **The prompt file is the only operator state.** It lives at
  `$IEG_PROMPT_FILE`, else `<state-dir>/ieg/prompt.md`, resolved by
  `resolvePromptPath()`. The section text and the read-only `ieg_status` report
  now read the *same* live resolution, so a reported source can no longer
  disagree with the text actually emitted — a defect the release gate caught
  while migrating, alongside the loss of the per-assembly re-read that the control
  plane had been providing.

### Added

- **TypeScript is the only hand-written runtime language**, stated in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and enforced by the packaging suite. Generated `lib/**`, the
  host-mandated `bin/ieg` shim, and the tooling under `scripts/`, `eval/` and
  `test/` are the documented exceptions.
- The release gate verifies the *removed* commands are gone rather than merely
  hidden, and that `prompt edit` refuses a bad candidate without writing.

### External

- Submitted IEG to the curated DSH plugin list: **awesome-dsh-plugin PR #6521**
  (`data/plugins/ccneedb__dsh-information-environment-governance.yml`). Discovery
  is the ecosystem's existing mechanism — the `dsh-plugin` npm keyword and GitHub
  topic plus a `dsh.bundle` manifest; there is no official DSH marketplace
  protocol, and no IEG-specific one was invented.

### Not done in this release

- Full documentation convergence. `README.md` and `TESTING.md` were updated for
  the reduced surface; `docs/PACKAGE-REFERENCE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC-AGENT-REFERENCE.md`,
  `MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md` and `TYPESCRIPT-MIGRATION.md` still describe parts of
  the removed lifecycle surface and are the next pass.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-10-03

**Distribution and installation-path repair.**

### Fixed

- **The installation instructions contradicted themselves.** They told a user to
  run `dsh-ieg install …` as the first step, but `dsh-ieg` is supplied *by* the
  package — on a clean machine that command is `bash: dsh-ieg: command not found`,
  which is exactly what a user hit. Every documented first-install flow now uses
  the host's own installer, and `dsh-ieg` is documented strictly as a
  **post-install** management interface.
- **The CLI's real invocation is now documented.** pnpm installs `dsh-ieg` into
  the profile rather than onto `PATH`, so the dependable command is
  `"$DSH_HOME/profiles/<profile>/node_modules/.bin/dsh-ieg"`; a global npm install
  or `npx dsh-ieg` are the alternatives.

### Changed

- **The package is publishable.** `private` is removed and
  `publishConfig.access` is `public`; keywords now carry `dsh-plugin`,
  `information-environment` and `dsh-bundle`. Publication itself remains a
  maintainer release action, withheld pending Gates C and D and the publish-target
  decision (§34.2 Q5) — the registry name `dsh-information-environment-governance`
  is currently unclaimed, and this changelog does not claim npm availability.
- **Discovery uses the ecosystem's existing mechanism** rather than an invented
  one: npm keywords plus the repository's GitHub topics (`dsh-plugin`, `dsh`,
  `deepseek-harness`, `information-environment`). The installed DSH exposes no
  marketplace protocol to implement; its plugin manager accepts a registry name,
  an absolute path, a git address or a tarball.
- **Version information consolidated.** `package.json` and `PLUGIN_VERSION` both
  read `0.9.1`; the declared peer range is documented as a compatibility
  statement, not a tested-versions list (exactly one release, `0.2.1-alpha.1`, is
  verified). Front matter across the documents was realigned.

### Added

- **The release gate now verifies the distribution path**: `scripts/verify.sh`
  packs the artifact with `npm pack`, installs **that tarball** into a fresh
  throwaway profile through the DSH-native command, asserts the `ieg` row
  composes, and asserts the shipped runtime, bundle patch and profile-local
  `dsh-ieg` command are present. 27 checks in total, up from 22.
- **A verified installation procedure for agents and operators** in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, stating the install order, forbidding wrappers that bootstrap
  through `dsh-ieg`, and recording the discovery and claim rules.

### Notes

- No runtime governance behaviour changed: the compiled prompt and
  `PROMPT_VERSION` `0.4.0` are untouched, and no new scope was introduced.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-10-03

**Prompt optimization, README positioning, and a read-only tool fix.** The
governance text is now **2,677 bytes**, down from 2,922, and `PROMPT_VERSION`
moves from `0.3.0` to `0.4.0`. The three governed areas, every pinned
obligation and the prompt-content rules are unchanged; what left the prompt was
redundancy, enforcement narration, and a rationale the module already states.

### Changed — the prompt, change by change

The division of responsibility applied here is: **runtime** enforces
mechanically, **state** records current information status, and the **prompt**
carries only semantic interpretation, priorities and judgment rules that runtime
cannot reliably express. Each change below is recorded as change → reason →
expected effect → regression check (ARCHITECTURE-SPEC §22.3, PRODUCT-SPEC
PR-07).

1. **The section header now names the Information Environment and absorbs the
   duplicated invariant.** *Reason:* the "supplements the host instructions /
   never replaces them" rule appeared twice — once in the header and once as the
   first kernel invariant — and the compiler's §5.2 dedupe cannot see the header,
   so the duplication was invisible to every check. *Expected effect:* the scope
   is stated where the model first reads it, with one fewer bullet and no net
   growth. *Regression check:* the pinned `never outranks a direct user
   instruction` and `the host instruction governs` phrases now live in the header
   and still match the conformance suite; the kernel-principle presence check
   passes because the invariant is no longer a kernel principle.
2. **`information-integrity`: dropped the rationale clause** "because a later
   reader can still pick it up and the annotation does not stop them".
   *Reason:* the module's own fragment already says the claim must not be
   encounterable on its own, so the principle stated it twice. *Expected effect:*
   −85 bytes, identical obligation. *Regression check:* the conformance suite
   still pins `Delete information you have established is wrong`, `Never leave it
   in place annotated as wrong` and `remove it at the source`, and the §5.2
   dedupe still keeps the fragment.
3. **`workspace-governance`: removed the principle** "Treat new persistent
   artifacts and structural changes as requiring authorization under the active
   policy." *Reason:* it restates what `tools/pre-execute` and `ctx.tools.guard`
   already enforce, which the prompt-content rules forbid; the prompt's job is
   the judgment that an approval is not standing authorization, not narration of
   the enforcement. *Expected effect:* −115 bytes. *Regression check:* the
   `no instruction restates a deterministically enforced rule` test and the OBJ-2
   overlap assertions still pass.
4. **`workspace-governance`: the fragment no longer narrates how approval is
   routed** ("A persistent mutation may be routed to the user for approval,
   and …"). *Reason:* routing is runtime/state behaviour the model cannot act on;
   the semantic part is the grant's scope. *Expected effect:* −45 bytes, same
   judgment. *Regression check:* the conformance suite still pins `each approval
   covers only that one change`.

No `user-attention` guidance was present to remove — that capability left in
`0.7.0` (see that entry); this round confirms its absence rather than repeating
it. **No behavioural improvement is claimed:** Gates C and D remain unmeasured,
and the prompt change was validated by the prompt-conformance suite and the
structural simulation only (Batch 3 §2 was executed at that level by explicit
decision).

### Fixed

- **`ieg_status` now renders content to the model.** The tool declared
  `render: () => []`, so every call succeeded, returned nothing to the caller,
  and left an operator unable to see the mount record, the compatibility verdict
  or the diagnostic ring — observed live while diagnosing a mutation block.
  `render` now projects the canonical value as JSON text, and the wiring suite
  asserts that the rendered content is non-empty and carries the mount record.
  The tool's JSON schema stays `{ type: "object" }`: the host rejects a
  non-standard `{ type: "json" }` schema, and because registration is guarded a
  bad schema silently removes the tool instead of failing loudly (caught by the
  real-tool-runtime integration test).

### Documentation

- README positioning now answers directly what it is, what it governs, what it
  does **not** govern and who it is for, states the product message (keep the
  project environment clearer and more consistent over time — not a smarter
  agent) as an intended benefit rather than a guarantee, and adds a concise
  Chinese section that preserves the anchor term 信息环境 / Information
  Environment. English remains the project's working language and its
  authoritative documentation.
- The package version, `PROMPT_VERSION` and the prompt byte figures were swept
  across the documents so no page describes the previous prompt revision.

> **Release status.** `package.json` declares `version: "0.9.1"`, is **publishable**
> (no `private` flag, `publishConfig.access: "public"`) and is **not published** to
> npm; `dsh.engines.dsh` is narrowed to the current verified range
> (`>=0.2.1-alpha.1 <0.3.0`). The publish target (§34.2 Q5) stays open until the
> behavioural and information-integrity gates (C, D) are met. Each release is
> published as a **GitHub release for volunteer testing** (a tag plus a packed
> tarball) — that is the developer/recovery source, not the normal user install
> path; the older entries stay staged under **Unreleased** below.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-10-03

**Breaking.** The DSH migration and packaging round. The repository root is now the
installable DSH component, the supported host baseline moves to `0.2.1-alpha.1`, and
the runtime is authored in TypeScript. `PROMPT_VERSION` is **unchanged** (`0.3.0`):
the compiled governance text is byte-identical, because this round deliberately does
not optimize the prompt.

### Fixed

- **The package can be installed as a DSH component from a Git URL.** The repository
  root now declares `dsh.bundle.patch`, so DSH accepts it as a profile bundle. Before
  this release the package lived in a `plugin/` subdirectory and the repository root
  carried **no manifest at all**; DSH's plugin installer therefore read a
  manifest-less dependency and refused it with `not-a-bundle` — "*declares no
  dsh.bundle*" — which is what the Web UI reported when adding the repository.

### Changed

- **The repository root is the package (breaking).** `package.json`,
  `cordis.patch.yml`, `bin/`, `lib/`, `src/`, `test/`, `test-support/`, `tsconfig*.json`
  and `CHANGELOG.md` moved from `plugin/` to the repository root, and `plugin/` no
  longer exists. Every path reference in the documents, scripts, workflows and tests
  was updated.
- **Host baseline migrated to `dsh 0.2.1-alpha.1` (breaking).** `dsh.engines.dsh`
  narrows to `>=0.2.1-alpha.1 <0.3.0` and `dsh.compatibility.dshReleases` is replaced
  by the single current entry; the retired `0.2.0-rc.2` baseline is gone from the peer
  range and the release map. `lib/compatibility-baseline.json` was re-captured against
  the installed host: the ordered section names, the host prompt hash (`ceb63ee5`) and
  the required capability set are identical to the previous baseline, so the prompt
  surface is semantically unchanged.
- **Single-baseline compatibility policy.** The plugin supports the current declared
  DSH baseline only. No version-conditional runtime path existed to remove — the
  adapter observes seam facts against the committed baseline rather than branching on
  a version string — and none is added.
- **Runtime authored in TypeScript.** `src/**/*.ts` is the source of truth and
  `lib/**` is its build output (`tsconfig.build.json` now emits to `lib/`, not the
  retired `lib/generated/`). Every runtime module migrated: the kernel, the four→three
  governance modules, the control plane, the prompt store and lifecycle, the CLI entry,
  and the aggregator `src/index.ts`. `lib/contract.d.ts` remains the one hand-authored
  ambient declaration file. No hand-maintained JavaScript remains in the runtime, and
  the compiled output is committed so a Git install is self-contained (pnpm does not
  run a build for a git dependency).
- **Module descriptors now declare `version: '0.2.0'`.** The shipped
  `project-governance`, `information-integrity`, and `workspace-governance`
  descriptors had still carried `0.1.0`, contradicting the `0.2.0` module contracts
  in `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC-AGENT-REFERENCE.md` §24. The descriptors were brought to the
  contract version, so one version is authoritative (closes §34.2 Q9).
- **Repository metadata** names the renamed upstream repository
  (`ccneedb/dsh-information-environment-governance`) in `repository`, `homepage` and
  `bugs`.

### Added

- **`test/integration/packaging.test.js`** — the structural regression this defect
  demanded: it asserts that the root is a valid DSH bundle, that the declared baseline
  is the only supported one, that the `files` allowlist ships the manifest and the
  compiled entry, that the retired layout and withdrawn capability are absent, and that
  every built module has a TypeScript source.
- **`bounded-repair` (OBJ-3)** — the missing workspace-hygiene evaluation scenario, so
  all three governed areas (project constraint, information/document integrity,
  workspace hygiene) now have one. `eval/README.md` states explicitly that a green
  structural suite is not evidence of behavioural improvement.

### Notes

- Gates C and D remain **unmeasured**; no behavioural claim is made by this release.
- The durable state domain is unchanged (`ieg_governance`, `DOMAIN_VERSION` 1).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-10-03

**Breaking.** The Information Environment Governance re-baseline. The
`user-attention` capability is **removed**, not disabled; the project, package, CLI,
environment variables, prompt section, tools, diagnostic namespace, and durable-state
domain are renamed from the historical ABG identifiers to the IEG identifiers; and the
injected governance text changes, so `PROMPT_VERSION` moves from `0.2.0` to `0.3.0`.

### Removed

- **The `user-attention` module, failure class `FC-2.4`, the question ledger, and the
  batch-completeness/redundancy gates.** Classification: **"Out of Scope / Externally
  Solved"** — testing found a stable prompt-level solution, so runtime governance of
  question batching is no longer justified. This is **not** a failed feature, and it
  must not appear as a current capability anywhere. `FC-2.4` is gone: the remaining
  classes `FC-2.1`–`FC-2.3` are each claimed by exactly one module.
- The `record_question` and `ieg_questions` tools (the question-ledger surface), and the
  question-related diagnostic codes (`ieg.question_registered`, `ieg.question_submitted`,
  `ieg.question_batch_created`, `ieg.question_batch_blocked`, `ieg.question_redundant`,
  `ieg.question_deferred`).
- The `question-consolidation` evaluation scenario and the evaluation-only
  `eval/answerer/` plugin. The behavioural and information-integrity gates (C, D) have
  **no current measurement** for this revision.
- The `userAttention` configuration key (see Changed).

### Changed

- **Scope re-baseline: Information Environment Governance.** IEG governs the
  Information Environment — the persistent information and project constraints that an
  agent continuously encounters, relies on, modifies, or inherits while working on a
  project (the canonical definition lives in `PRODUCT-SPEC.md` §1.1). Two governance entry
  points: **Project Constraint Governance** and **Information / Document Governance**.
  Workspace hygiene is an enforcement mechanism within the second, not a sandbox or
  security system. General AI safety/security, sandboxing, authorization,
  user-attention optimization, and unrelated agent behavior management are explicitly
  out of scope.
- **Repository, package, CLI, and identifiers renamed.** Package
  `dsh-agent-behavioral-governance` → **`dsh-information-environment-governance`**; CLI
  and `bin` `abg` → **`dsh-ieg`** (`bin/ieg`, source `src/bin/ieg.ts` → compiled
  `lib/bin/ieg.js`); environment variables `ABG_*` → **`IEG_STATE_FILE`,
  `IEG_DSH_PACKAGES`, `IEG_VERIFY_HOME`**; prompt section `abg:governance` →
  **`ieg:governance`**; runtime-context line `abg:status` → **`ieg:status`**; tools
  `abg_status` / `abg_questions` / `record_question` → **`ieg_status`** and
  `record_orientation`; diagnostic namespace `abg.*` → **`ieg.*`**; durable-state domain
  `abg_governance` → **`ieg_governance`** (`DOMAIN_VERSION` 1); throwaway
  profiles/directories `.abg-e2e/`, `.abg-verify/` → **`.ieg-e2e/`, `.ieg-verify/`**.
- **`PROMPT_VERSION` `0.2.0` → `0.3.0`.** The compiled governance section is now
  **2922 bytes** against a recorded ceiling of **3215 bytes** (floor 1400, hard cap
  4096). The section is registered at order 8500 with `interpolate: false`; `complete`
  is never set.
- **The `userAttention` config key is removed and is now rejected.** Supplying it is an
  unknown-key configuration error: IEG refuses the whole configuration and mounts its
  observable fault surface rather than silently ignoring the field. Top-level keys are
  `enabled`, `sectionOrder`, `modules`, `workspace`, `preStep`, `prompt`, `diagnostics`,
  and `diagnosticsExport`. All three remaining modules — `project-governance` (FC-2.1),
  `information-integrity` (FC-2.3), `workspace-governance` (FC-2.2) — ship default-on.
- **Two model-facing tools remain:** `record_orientation` and `ieg_status`.

### Documentation

- Package-level documentation, the behavioural evaluation harness, and the repository
  scripts/CI were updated to the IEG names, the three-module capability set, and the
  renumbered acceptance gates A–J.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-10-03

**Breaking.** The Web GUI route and the in-harness feedback feature are **removed**,
not disabled, and replaced by a terminal interface, `abg`, run from a Debian shell.
`PROMPT_VERSION` is unchanged (`0.2.0`): the compiled governance text is identical.

### Added

- **`abg`, the terminal interface** (`src/bin/abg.ts`, shipped as `bin/abg`).
  Running it with no arguments opens an ANSI numbered menu — no dependencies, no
  ncurses, usable over SSH — and every command also works non-interactively with
  flags, because CI and scripts call it.
- **The control plane** (`src/kernel/control.ts`): a small, stable JSON record at
  `$ABG_STATE_FILE`, else `<state-dir>/abg/state.json` (`<state-dir>` =
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME` or `~/.local/state`), written atomically (temp + rename).
  `abg start|pause|restart|exit` change `status`; an **absent file means
  `running`**, so every pre-0.6.0 install behaves exactly as before; a corrupt file
  means `running` plus a recorded diagnostic, never a crash. `restart` bumps
  `generation`, which is the plugin's signal to invalidate cached configuration
  and prompt.
- **The prompt store** (`src/kernel/prompt-store.ts`): prompt text now lives in a
  sibling `prompt.md`, not inside the control JSON. It is validated through the
  existing `composePromptOverride` kernel (no `{{ }}`, byte ceiling unless
  `allowOverBudget`), attributed as `0.2.0+user:<hash>`, and refused with its
  reasons — a refusal keeps the previous effective text. `abg prompt edit` opens
  `$EDITOR` on a temporary copy; `abg prompt reset` deletes the file and returns to
  the compiled default.
- **The npm-native lifecycle** (`src/kernel/lifecycle.ts`): `abg install|update|
  uninstall` is now the single implementation. `scripts/abg-npm.sh` is a thin
  wrapper over it. It refuses to write the live `$HOME/.dsh` without `--allow-live`
  (exit 2) and defaults npm's cache to a writable home-local directory rather than
  a read-only `~/.npm`.
- **Plugin-side gating** in `lib/index.js`: the control state is re-read (cached by
  mtime; a re-stat per assembly/step is allowed). `paused` emits no prompt section
  and lets every hook pass through; `stopped` mounts nothing active, like
  `enabled: false`; `running` is normal. New diagnostic codes:
  `abg.control_paused`, `abg.control_resumed`, `abg.control_stopped`,
  `abg.control_generation_changed`, `abg.control_state_unreadable`.
- A CLI smoke check, a `prompt.md` round-trip check and a **gating** check in
  `scripts/verify.sh` (a `paused` state suppresses the section; a generation bump
  re-reads `prompt.md`). The installed-patch proof that applies the shipped
  `cordis.patch.yml` verbatim is preserved.

### Removed

- `lib/client.js`; the `dsh.client` manifest; the `./client` export.
- The Web routes in `lib/index.js` (`/api/abg/status`, `/api/abg/prompt`,
  `/api/abg/feedback`), the `ctx.webServer` injection, and the `gui` configuration
  block with its contract types.
- `lib/kernel/gui-actions.js` and `lib/kernel/feedback.js`; the
  `abg_report_issue` tool; the `feedback` configuration block with its contract
  types.
- The GUI-route and feedback test cases; `docs/TASK-FAILURE-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md`
  (deviation reports are now ordinary GitHub issues via `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`).
- `abg.gui_route_registered` from the diagnostic vocabulary.

### Kept

- The diagnostics ring **and** the opt-in diagnostics mirror
  (`src/kernel/export.ts` → `lib/kernel/export.js`); the
  CLI is now the mirror's reader.
- All four governance modules; `abg_status`, `abg_questions`, `record_orientation`,
  `record_question`; `apply()` still never throws (§26.2).

### Documentation

- `README.md`, `TESTING.md`, `docs/PACKAGE-REFERENCE.md`,
  `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC-AGENT-REFERENCE.md` (§28.6/§28.8 replaced by one control-plane
  section; §28.7 kept with the CLI as its reader), `MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md` and
  `TYPESCRIPT-MIGRATION.md` all describe the terminal interface; no
  document still describes the removed surfaces as live.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-10-02

**This fixes a defect that made every default install of 0.4.0 and 0.5.0 inert.**

### Fixed

- **A shipped configuration the plugin itself rejected.** `cordis.patch.yml`
  ships `prompt.file: ''` and `diagnosticsExport.file: ''` — documented values
  meaning "none configured"/"off" — but both were validated with a
  non-empty-string check. `buildGovernance()` therefore threw on the shipped
  configuration, and because `apply()` must not throw (§26.2) ABG fell into its
  fault surface: **no prompt section, no hooks, no tools, and no GUI route**, with
  nothing reported by the host. Path fields now accept the empty string and still
  reject whitespace-only values.
- **The diagnostics mirror wrote an empty snapshot.** The forced flush ran before
  the mount records existed and the throttle then suppressed them, so the mirror
  was written once, empty, and never refreshed. It now flushes after `abg.mount`.
- **The gate could not see the defect.** `verify.sh` proved activation by applying
  `{}` (all defaults) rather than the shipped patch, so a package whose own config
  was rejected passed. The installed-artifact proof now applies the shipped
  `cordis.patch.yml` verbatim and asserts the prompt section still binds.

### Added

- `npm run build` (`src/**/*.ts` → `lib/`) is now check 1 of the gate, so
  emitted artifacts can never be validated stale (12 checks).
- `scripts/abg-npm.sh` and `scripts/abg-npm-lifecycle-check.sh`: an npm-native
  install/update/uninstall path. Note the verified host fact — plain
  `npm install` does **not** register the profile bundle, so the helper also
  maintains `dsh.profile.bundles`; `dsh plugin` itself forwards to pnpm.
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md` and `scripts/check-docs.sh`: one authoritative
  home per information kind, with link, front-matter and index-coverage checking
  wired into CI.
- The first slice of the TypeScript migration: three kernel modules now have
  `.ts` sources with emitted JS and declarations as build artifacts
  (`TYPESCRIPT-MIGRATION.md` records the exception list and the plan).

### Documentation

- The Web GUI panel requires a **Web** profile; a headless profile has no web app,
  so no panel can appear there however the plugin is installed. `check-install.sh`
  now says which situation you are in and names the Web-capable profiles.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-10-02

The Web GUI panel becomes editable: it can now change the prompt and file
feedback, not just show status.

### Added

- **Prompt editor in the panel.** `POST /api/abg/prompt` persists an edited
  section text, and the change applies to the next assembly without a restart
  (the section provider is function-valued). The editor is **disabled unless
  `prompt.mode` is `replace` and `prompt.file` names a path** — there is
  deliberately no default write target, so an unconfigured deployment gets a
  read-only editor (409) rather than a surprise file. Validation runs through the
  same `composePromptOverride` as the file and the config, so an interpolation or
  over-budget edit is refused with the same wording (422 + issues), and an applied
  edit is attributed `PROMPT_VERSION+user:<hash>` and reports `promptUnchecked`.
- **Feedback form in the panel.** `POST /api/abg/feedback` composes through
  `composeFeedback`, so the browser path shares the kernel's redaction rather than
  reimplementing it. The form previews the exact markdown, copies it, opens the
  prefilled issue link, and files directly only in opt-in `api` mode.
- `lib/kernel/gui-actions.js`: the two write actions as pure functions with
  injected I/O, plus `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` bounding the accepted body.

### Changed

- `GET /api/abg/status` also reports the editor's view and the feedback mode.
- Package version `0.5.0`. For a default configuration (`prompt.mode: compiled`)
  the compiled section is byte-identical to `0.4.0`, so `PROMPT_VERSION` stays
  `0.2.0` unless an override applies.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-10-02

Adds the two capabilities a front end needs: a user-editable prompt and a
machine-readable diagnostics mirror. Neither is on by default in a way that
changes existing behaviour: `prompt.mode` defaults to `compiled` (the audited
generated section) and an empty `diagnosticsExport.file` means no file I/O.

### Added

- **User-editable prompt** (`lib/kernel/prompt-override.js`; `prompt{mode, append,
  file, allowOverBudget}`; `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC` §27.1). `append` adds guidance to
  the audited compiled section; `replace` substitutes a markdown file wholesale.
  Two hard requirements are enforced on any user text — no `{{ }}` interpolation
  syntax, and the §11 byte ceiling unless `allowOverBudget` is set deliberately —
  and a refused edit **falls back to the compiled default and reports why**
  (`abg.prompt_override_rejected` / `abg.prompt_override_missing`) rather than
  mounting inert or silently ignoring the text. An applied edit is attributed as
  `PROMPT_VERSION+user:<hash>`, and the soft invariants the conformance suite
  cannot check on user text (dedupe, no authority claim, no implementation
  leakage, no restating an enforced rule) are returned as `promptUnchecked` and
  reported, so a user-edited prompt is never presented as an audited one.
- **Opt-in diagnostics mirror** (`lib/kernel/export.js`;
  `diagnosticsExport{file, limit}`; `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC` §28.7). Writes a bounded
  JSON snapshot (mount record, status line, counts, newest `limit` diagnostics)
  for a front end that cannot read the in-process ring. Off unless a path is
  configured; throttled while diagnostics stream; written via a temporary file
  and rename; and fail-open with the failure reported once per window, with an
  explicit re-entrancy guard because the report itself records a diagnostic.
- Three new diagnostic codes for the above, and two more for the mirror.

- **Web GUI panel** (`lib/client.js`, `lib/` host route; `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC`
  §28.8). A sidebar entry opens a read-only panel showing the mount record,
  `degraded[]`, the compatibility verdict, `PROMPT_VERSION`, and the diagnostic
  ring, read from the new host route `/api/abg/status` (behind the deployment's
  `/api` browser-trust fence). The client bundle is **hand-authored**: a DSH
  client plugin normally ships a `lib/client.js` built by the monorepo, and there
  is no public out-of-tree build, so it is written directly against the lazy-CJS
  envelope and the slot registry. Verified end to end in an isolated web profile.
- The GUI route records its own outcome in-band (`abg.gui_route_registered`, or
  `abg.capability_missing` when no web server is mounted), because an `inject`
  that never fires otherwise looks exactly like a route that does not exist.

### Fixed

- **The diagnostics mirror showed an empty ring.** The setup flush happened before
  the mount records existed and the throttle then suppressed them, so the file was
  written once, empty, and never refreshed until the next diagnostic. A final
  forced flush at mount fixes it; caught by the web-profile verification, which is
  the first run where the mirror was read by something other than its own tests.
- **The web server service is `webServer`, not `webserver`.** The first GUI route
  attempt injected the wrong name, so the route was never registered — silently,
  because an unfired `inject` reports nothing. Caught by the same verification.

### Changed

- **Package version is now `0.4.0`.** For a default configuration the compiled
  section is byte-identical to `0.3.0`, so `PROMPT_VERSION` remains `0.2.0`
  unless a deployment applies an override, in which case it becomes
  `0.2.0+user:<hash>`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-10-02

Adds the volunteer-facing surface: a way to obtain the plugin, and a one-step
channel for reporting a behavioural deviation from inside the session. No
model-facing prompt text changed, so `PROMPT_VERSION` stays `0.2.0` and the §11
byte budget is untouched.

### Added

- **Optional feedback channel** (`lib/kernel/feedback.js`, the read-only
  `abg_report_issue` tool, and the `feedback{enabled, mode, repository,
  tokenEnvVar, labels, includeDiagnostics}` configuration block;
  `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC` §28.6). Given a one-line summary it returns a prefilled
  GitHub issue link and the markdown body, composed from the mount record,
  `degraded[]`, the compatibility verdict, and diagnostic *codes*. Two properties
  are the point: it **never files anything by itself** in the default `url` mode
  (no network call, no credential; a human submits), and it is **redacted by
  construction** — diagnostic payloads, agent and session identifiers, file
  contents, prompts, and session logs are dropped before composition, which
  `test/unit/feedback.test.js` pins by planting a secret in a diagnostic payload.
  `mode: api` is strictly opt-in, reads a token from the environment variable
  named by `feedback.tokenEnvVar` (never from configuration), and fails open to
  the prefilled link on any error.
- **Volunteer testing guide** (`TESTING.md`): two installation methods (release
  tarball, or clone plus `file:` install), the first-trial configuration, the
  ABG-disabled A/B procedure that the missing evidence actually needs, the
  uninstall command, and the reporting workflow.
- **Runtime ambient declarations** in `lib/contract.d.ts` for the two globals the
  feedback channel touches (`process.env`, `fetch`), so the package keeps its
  no-dependency, no-`@types/node` property while that dependency stays auditable
  in one file.

### Changed

- **Package version is now `0.3.0`** (capability addition; `PROMPT_VERSION`
  remains `0.2.0` because no injected section text changed).
- **The installed-artifact proof and the wiring suite now expect five tools**
  (`abg_report_issue` in addition to the two capture tools and two read-only
  surfaces), and `cordis.patch.yml` documents the `feedback` block.
- **CI installs TypeScript explicitly** in both jobs. The package ships zero
  dependencies by design, so a clean runner has no compiler; the alternative —
  adding a `devDependency` — would have muddied that contract.

## [Unreleased] — target v0.2.0

### Removed

- **`child-agent-lifecycle` (failure class `FC-2.5`) — withdrawn by explicit
  user decision recorded in `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC-AGENT-REFERENCE.md` §23.** The
  module, its `subagent/*` listeners, its ambient contract types, its prompt
  fragment, its unit test, its composition toggle, and the remaining
  product-level clauses that referred to it (`FC-2.5`, `G5`, `PR-06`, the
  lifecycle quality target and quality row, and the old success criterion 4)
  were removed. Rationale: Part A's reconnaissance established that a populated
  child list is expected on a healthy system and that automatic reclamation was
  unfounded, and the evaluation harness contains no delegation scenario, so the
  module could never have acquired behavioural evidence.
  - **Prompt impact (attributed to the withdrawal decision §23).** The compiled
    governance section drops from 3,905 bytes over five modules to 3,459 bytes
    over four. This is a change to injected model-facing text, so §31.2 requires
    at least a minor bump.
  - **Prompt version.** `PROMPT_VERSION` is `0.2.0` for the four-module text.
  - **Gate K (withdrawal integrity).** The plugin ships four modules, and no
    import, config key, prompt fragment, test, or documentation claim refers to
    the removed module.

### Added

- **Scope-isolated, per-agent governance state** (`lib/kernel/state.js`; used by
  `lib/index.js`, `lib/kernel/orientation.js`, `lib/kernel/questions.js`).
  Closes the `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC` §17.7 defect that two live agents in one
  composition shared one orientation record and one question ledger, and
  satisfies **Gate H** ("two live agents in one composition never share
  governance state"). It also sharpens **Gate F** (regression resilience) from
  per-composition to per-agent and per-session.
- **Diagnostics channel** (`lib/kernel/diagnostics.js`, the read-only
  `abg_status` tool, and the `abg:status` runtime-context line). Closes
  `MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md` §4 **blocker 1** ("diagnostics are invisible ... every
  `ctx.logger` diagnostic ABG emits is buffered and never displayed") and
  satisfies **Gate G**: mount, configuration, last denial, and the compatibility
  verdict are observable from the transcript alone, under the §28.5 fallback
  when channel A is unavailable.
- **Compatibility adapter** (`lib/kernel/compatibility.js`). Closes
  `MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md` §4 **blocker 2** ("no compatibility adapter; a host
  upgrade would go undetected") and satisfies **Gate I**: the adapter reports a
  verdict (`COMPATIBLE` / `COMPATIBLE_WITH_WARNINGS` / `UNSUPPORTED` / `PENDING`)
  and detects a simulated host section change. The enforced peer range remains
  the authoritative version gate (§34.1 B4).
- **Question consolidation at runtime** (`lib/kernel/questions.js` and the
  `record_question` ledger the `tools/pre-execute` gate consults). Closes
  `MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md` §4 **blocker 4** ("`user-attention` behavioural
  validation is structurally blocked in headless: there is no question answerer")
  at the runtime-wiring level and feeds **Gate D**: the gate refuses an
  `ask_user_question` batch that omits a registered blocker, and `PRODUCT-SPEC`
  success criterion #3's behavioural measurement ("batching reduces interactions
  without suppressing critical uncertainty") is delivered by the evaluation
  harness (§30.4, phase P5/P6), not by this change.
- **Gate-precision evaluation** (`test/integration/gate-precision.test.js`).
  Closes `MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md` §4 **blocker 3** ("false positives
  unmeasured") and satisfies `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC` §32.4: a corpus of at least 12
  legitimate operations plus the declared traps, with `false_block_rate`,
  `false_blocks`, and `true_blocks` measured and printed rather than assumed.
  The target is `false_block_rate = 0`.
- **Packaging and release policy** (`LICENSE`, this `CHANGELOG.md`, and the
  `files` allowlist). Closes `MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md` §4 **blocker 6** ("not a
  publishable package: no release policy, no changelog, no LICENSE inside
  `plugin/`") and satisfies **Gate J** (installability against a real profile is
  asserted by `scripts/verify.sh`). The package is licensed MIT; its peer range,
  compatibility entry, and zero runtime dependencies are unchanged.

### Changed

- **`apply()` no longer throws — the §26.2 mount contract is implemented.**
  Previously a configuration fault (unknown key, unknown module id, invalid
  enum, over-budget prompt) escaped `apply()`; the host reports a throwing entry
  as `warning: N entry did not activate` and continues, so a deployment was left
  without governance and without a transcript-visible reason. Now:
  - a configuration fault mounts an **inert but observable** surface —
    `mountConfigFaultSurface()` registers the read-only `abg_status` tool and the
    `abg:status` context line reporting `mounted: false` with the validator's
    message and an `abg.config_invalid` diagnostic, and registers **no** prompt
    section and **no** enforcement (fail-safe, never wrong enforcement);
  - every capability registers in its **own guarded step** (prompt section,
    status context, the three listeners, the tool definitions, the guard, the
    storage domain and its disposer), so one unavailable seam costs only that
    seam;
  - an **absent** seam is recorded as `abg.capability_missing` and listed in the
    new `degraded[]` field of the mount record, so a partial mount is
    distinguishable from a complete one (`mounted` alone could not express this);
  - a **durable-store construction failure** now falls back to a no-op store
    instead of propagating;
  - **logger narration is best-effort** everywhere, so a deployment whose logger
    throws (or that mounts no exporter, §28.1) still gets the ring, the status
    line, and the tools.
  Closes `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC` §26.2, which was specified but unimplemented, and
  sharpens **Gate G**. Covered by four tests in `wiring.test.js`. Not
  model-facing text, so `PROMPT_VERSION` is unchanged.
- **`preStep.requireBeforeMutation` now defaults to `false`** in
  `lib/kernel/config.js` and in the shipped `cordis.patch.yml` row, implementing
  the user decision recorded in `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC` §34.2 Q1 (non-intrusive
  defaults). The orientation requirement is unchanged as a mechanism and remains
  available as an explicit opt-in; before this change a default deployment
  denied the first persistent write of every session. Closes
  `MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md` §4 **blocker 7**. Not model-facing text, so
  `PROMPT_VERSION` is unchanged.
- **The prompt-byte ceiling is now the recorded footprint rule of
  `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC` §34.1 B6.** `lib/kernel/prompt-compiler.js` records
  `RECORDED_PROMPT_BYTES = 3459` and derives the ceiling as
  `min(PROMPT_BYTE_HARD_CAP, max(PROMPT_BYTE_FLOOR, recorded + 10 %))` —
  **3,805 bytes** from a 1,400-byte floor and a 4,096-byte hard cap — replacing
  a fixed `4,096` in the compiler and an independent, unreachable `4,200`
  ceiling in the conformance suite. Compiler and conformance tests now read the
  same constants, so they cannot disagree about the budget. Closes
  `ARCHITECTURE-SPEC` §34.1 assumption **B6**. Not model-facing text, so
  `PROMPT_VERSION` is unchanged.
- **`dsh.compatibility.dshReleases` records `0.2.0-rc.2` as `verified`** without
  narrowing `dsh.engines.dsh` in this change. Per §31.2, a new host release is
  added to that map only after the compatibility baseline test passes; the
  peer-range decision is the Lead's.

### Fixed

- **The shell-write classifier no longer mistakes quoted text for shell
  syntax.** `workspace.classifyShellCommands` is the mechanism that closes the
  redirection coverage hole left by excluding shell tools from `mutatingTools`,
  so its precision decides whether D13's requirement survives its own amendment.
  Quoted segments are now treated as data unless the command wraps another
  command, and a `>` is a redirection only when it is a standalone operator
  rather than an arrow or a comparison. `rg '=>' src`,
  `grep -rn 'a > b' src`, and `git commit -m 'rm stale files'` are read-only
  again, while `bash -c 'rm -rf build'` and `echo x > f` remain mutations. Both
  directions and the two residual limits are pinned by
  `test/unit/shell-classification.test.js`, and the newly found false-positive
  cases are counted in the §32.4 matrix, which now measures **21 legitimate
  calls with `false_block_rate = 0`** and 4/4 traps caught.
- **`lib/kernel/durability.js` attributed Gate F to Gate G** in its header
  comment; the durable-state gate is F (Gate G is diagnosability). The same
  correction was applied to both durability test files.
- **The suite's last permanently-red marker is gone.** `durability.test.js` still
  carried a `todo` test asserting "orientation survives a resume" in a
  composition that deliberately mounts **no** storage facility, so it executed and
  failed on every run while Node demoted it and the runner exited 0 — a green
  `verify.sh` that hid a red body. The assertion belongs to
  `durability-storage.test.js`, which mounts the real storage stack and verifies
  it; the redundant `todo` was deleted and the remaining test now documents the
  accepted no-storage degradation. The suite is **228 tests, all passing, no
  todo, no skip**, so `node --test` exiting 0 now means every body ran and passed.
- **`verify.sh` check 5 was redesigned for the non-throwing mount.** It proved
  execution by feeding ABG a config only it could reject and grepping the host's
  stderr for the resulting `ModuleContractError` — which the §26.2 hardening now
  absorbs by design, so the check began failing. It now proves execution
  positively against the profile's **own installed copy** of the package (a real
  directory, not a link to the source tree): the installed artifact must bind one
  section, three listeners, and four tools, and must degrade a bad configuration
  into the observable fault surface; the host must then boot the real composition
  with that overlay and report no unactivated entry. The chain grew from 10 to
  **11 checks**, all passing.

### Notes on attribution

- The **only prompt-text change** in this change set is the withdrawal above,
  and it is attributed to the §23 user decision. The added capabilities are
  runtime and diagnostic; they do not alter the compiled section, so no further
  prompt attribution is claimed here.
- The **reconciliation change of 2026-10-02** (`requireBeforeMutation` default,
  the B6 ceiling, and the shell-classifier precision fix) touches configuration,
  enforcement, and tests but **no injected model-facing text**, so
  `PROMPT_VERSION` remains `0.2.0` and no prompt revision is claimed. The
  recorded footprint `RECORDED_PROMPT_BYTES` describes exactly that revision.
- Every other entry is attributed to the numbered blocker or gate it closes.
  If a later change alters injected model-facing text, add it under **Changed**
  with the problem or evaluation result that motivated it.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-01

- Initial prototype: five governance modules (`project-governance`,
  `information-integrity`, `user-attention`, `workspace-governance`, and the
  later-withdrawn `child-agent-lifecycle`), one additive system-prompt section
  at order `8500`, `tools/pre-execute` and `ctx.tools.guard` enforcement, the
  `record_orientation` and `record_question` tools, and durable per-session
  orientation through `ctx.storageDomain`.
- The `0.1.0` evidence chain (test run, `verify.sh` result, prompt size, and
  prompt version) is recorded in `MAINTENANCE-HANDOFF.md` and
  `IMPLEMENTATION-VALIDATION-HANDOFF.md`.
